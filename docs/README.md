"The torsional destructive test of the 18 cm, 16AWG stranded copper specimen resulted in a fracture angle of 831.74 degrees (approximately 2.3 revolutions). This high magnitude of twist demonstrates the significant ductility of the copper material and the mechanical flexibility inherent in stranded wire construction. The initial phase of rotation likely involved the compression of individual strands, followed by extensive plastic deformation typical of annealed copper. While the linear elastic theoretical model projected a peak torque of 958.09 mNm at the point of fracture, this value represents the theoretical elastic limit; the actual resisting torque plateaued earlier as the material yielded, confirming that the specimen failed due to shear strain well into the plastic region.
