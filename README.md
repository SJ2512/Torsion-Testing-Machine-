# Torsion Testing Machine (Current-Based Torque and torsional analysis)

A compact torsion test rig that estimates torque using motor current (ACS712-30A) and measures twist angle with a rotary encoder. The setup uses a BTS7960 motor driver, Arduino Nano, and a 3S LiPo supply. This build demonstrates the core mechanism and electronics for a small-scale torsion tester.

## Overview

The system applies twist to a test shaft and measures:

- **Torque (via motor current × Kt constant)**
- **Angle of twist (via rotary encoder counts)**

Due to unavailable couplers/rods during the build, full specimen testing wasn’t done — but the motor used can easily rotate steel/aluminium rods up to **≤6 mm diameter**. Future testing will be done once couplers arrive.

This project focuses on the **working prototype**, electronics, sensing method, and motion system.
