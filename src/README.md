## 📌 Status

- Prototype electronics and sensing system: **Working**  
- Full mechanical testing with rods: **Pending (parts unavailable during build)**  
- Motor is capable of testing thin shafts (<6 mm)  
- Future update will include full rod-testing once couplers arrive  

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This build is part of my portfolio to demonstrate:

- Sensor integration  
- Motor control with BTS7960  
- Current-based torque estimation  
- Encoder-based angle measurement  
- Embedded firmware on Arduino Nano  
- Practical testing machine design  

Not intended as a tutorial — this showcases the working prototype and core implementation.
